You are an intelligent agent for the 3D Visual Grounding task. You are given a query and many candidate solutions, each of which assigns an center and a size for each objects mentioned in the query (also given to you explicitly). Your task is to choose only one solution that is most appropriate, based on the content of the query.

Here are some tips:
- When dealing with complex spatial arrangements, it may be helpful to visualize the scenario and positions of objects based on their given centers and sizes.
- Always carefully compute and compare distances between objects, as 'close to' or 'far from' are often relative concepts dependent on the overall layout. 
- When checking view-dependent spatial relations like 'front', 'back', 'left', and 'right', remember to convert those into the concept of 'spatially close', or view from the center of all objects to get more accurate judgments.
- While the aim is to find the solution that fits all requirements, keep in mind that in certain situations, a solution might need to be chosen based on the majority of conditions being met, or some conditions might need to be loosened based on commonsense if none of the solutions are perfect. The goal is to choose the solution that most logically aligns with the given query.
- Carefully examining each solution: A quick overview may overlook critical differences between object placements or sizes. Each element in the query and solutions must be reviewed.
- Using mathematical calculations: Use computations to measure distances and sizes when necessary. Precise measurements will greatly aid in tasks with spatial arrangements and opting for the most accurate solution.
- Making judicious assumptions: In certain scenarios, we may need to make assumptions when the query or solutions are ambiguous. These assumptions should be logical and based on the given context, and must always be justified in your reasoning.
- Deploying basic geometry and physics: Simple concepts about distance, area, volume, trajectory, etc can play a pivotal role in generating a robust judgement.
- Considering multiple interpretations: Queries may have multiple potential interpretations. Try to identify alternative understandings, and see which solutions could fit.
- Contemplating real-world feasibility: In addition to spatial calculations and geometry, consider if the solution makes sense in a real-world scenario.

Example Input:

@QUERY
it is the largest cup on the table close to window.

@OBJECTS
cup_3, table_4, window_6

@SOLUTIONS
solution 0
cup_3: center=[5.913, -2.261, 1.161]; size=[0.323, 0.323, 0.323]
table_4: center=[5.913, -2.261, 0.000]; size=[2.000, 2.000, 2.000]
window_6: center=[5.891, -0.758, 2.327]; size=[2.000, 0.300, 2.000]

solution 1
cup_3: center=[5.913, -1.783, 1.09]; size=[0.180, 0.180, 0.180]
table_4: center=[5.913, -2.261, 0.000]; size=[2.000, 2.000, 2.000]
window_6: center=[5.891, -0.758, 2.327]; size=[2.000, 0.300, 2.000]

solution 2
cup_3: center=[2.201, -6.001, 1.354]; size=[0.323, 0.323, 0.709]
table_4: center=[2.206, -5.929, 0.000]; size=[2.000, 2.000, 2.000]
window_6: center=[5.891, -0.758, 2.327]; size=[2.000, 0.300, 2.000]

Example Output:

The task involves finding the most appropriate solution that aligns with the query - "it is the largest cup on the table close to window." Thus, we need to find a solution wherein the cup is the largest object among the cups and is close to the window while being on the table. 

Let's evaluate each solution:

Solution 0: This solution has the cup at the center [5.913, -2.261, 1.161] with size [0.323, 0.323, 0.323]. While it is greater in size than the cup in Solution 1, it is comparatively smaller in height than the one in Solution 2. Moreover, it is relatively closer to the window, although not as close as the one in Solution 1.

Solution 1: The cup in this solution is smaller in size than the cups in both Solution 0 and 2. Furthermore, while it is closer to the window than the cup in Solution 0, it is still not the largest object among the cups as required by the query.

Solution 2: This solution presents the cup of the largest size among all the cups, with a size of [0.323, 0.323, 0.709]. However, it is farther from the window than both Solutions 0 and 1, which makes it not an ideal selection as per the query requirement of the cup being close to the window. 

Considering all these details, Solution 0 results as the most appropriate choice as it presents the cup of the largest size close to the window. This confirms with the query as tightly as possible, as the cup in Solution 1 is smaller and the one in Solution 2 is farther away from the window.

Here is the answer in a format facilitating parsing:
@BEGIN{ANSWER}
correct solution index: [0]
