Here is a 3D Visual Grounding Query:
it is the largest cup on the table close to window.

To locate the target, you have previously generated a Python program, which identifies these objects:
cup_3, table_4, window_6

For each of the objects above, we can assign one of the candidates to it:
cup_3:
candidate_1: center=[5.913, -2.261, 1.161]; size=[0.323, 0.323, 0.323]
candidate_2: center=[5.913, -1.783, 1.09]; size=[0.180, 0.180, 0.180]
candidate_3: center=[2.201, -6.001, 1.354]; size=[0.323, 0.323, 0.709]

table_4:
candidate_1: center=[5.913, -2.261, 0.000]; size=[2.000, 2.000, 2.000]
candidate_2: center=[2.206, -5.929, 0.000]; size=[2.000, 2.000, 2.000]

window_5:
candidate_1: center=[5.891, -0.758, 2.327]; size=[2.000, 0.300, 2.000]

In the generated Python program, we have to check the relations between object candidates in order to find the most appropriate one for each object. To check the spatial relations, we define some thresholds:
near_distance: when the distance between two candidates assigned to two objects is below this threshold, they are considered to be "near" each other.
on_distance: when the center of object A of above the center of object B, and the distance between the centers of A and B is below this threshold, object A should be considered as "on" object B.

It is difficult to determine a good threshold for all queries. So your job is to determine for this specific query which values for the thresholds are the most appropriate ones. Please output the threshold name and its value on each line.

We assume that the query has only a single target, i.e., only a single candidate can be assigned to the target object. This means that the threshold values you give should exclude all irrelevant objects, except those needed to ground the target. Please choose your threshold values so that this is the case.

To determine the appropriate threshold values for the given query, we need to analyze the spatial relationships between the candidates for the objects "cup_3," "table_4," and "window_6."

Let's break down the query:
- The target is the largest cup.
- The cup is on the table.
- The table is near the window.

First, we need to identify the largest cup. From the given sizes:
- candidate_1: size=[0.323, 0.323, 0.323]
- candidate_2: size=[0.180, 0.180, 0.180]
- candidate_3: size=[0.323, 0.323, 0.709]

Candidate_3 is the largest cup.

Next, we need to determine which table the cup is on. We check the vertical distance (z-coordinate) between the cup and the tables:
- Cup candidate_3: center=[2.201, -6.001, 1.354]
- Table candidate_1: center=[5.913, -2.261, 0.000]
- Table candidate_2: center=[2.206, -5.929, 0.000]

The vertical distance between cup candidate_3 and table candidate_2 is 1.354, which is reasonable for the cup to be on the table.

Finally, we need to determine which table is near the window:
- Window candidate_1: center=[5.891, -0.758, 2.327]

We calculate the horizontal distance (x and y coordinates) between the tables and the window:
- Distance between table candidate_1 and window candidate_1: sqrt((5.913 - 5.891)^2 + (-2.261 + 0.758)^2) ≈ 2.36
- Distance between table candidate_2 and window candidate_1: sqrt((2.206 - 5.891)^2 + (-5.929 + 0.758)^2) ≈ 7.37

Table candidate_1 is closer to the window.

Based on this analysis, we need to set the thresholds such that:
- The largest cup (candidate_3) is on table candidate_2.
- Table candidate_2 is not considered near the window to exclude it.
- Table candidate_1 is considered near the window.

Thus, the appropriate threshold values are:
```
on_distance: 2.0
near_distance: 3.0
```

These threshold values ensure that only the relevant objects are considered for grounding the target cup.
